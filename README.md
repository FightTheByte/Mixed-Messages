**Version 2**

This program is a random sentence generator. 

As i'm still learning, functionality is limited. 

~~It bundles the sections into 3 arrays, that are all assigned to the same key.~~

The user can now add any amount of sentence chunks, in the form of a new index array.

It then calls each array with Math.random, using the length of each array element.

I've tried to keep this as simple and user friendly as possible, any amount of spliced sentences can be added to the array and it will retain it's functionality, enjoy!
